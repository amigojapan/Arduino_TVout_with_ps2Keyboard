Arduino_TVout_with_ps2Keyboard

This is the library that alows you to use both TVout and PS2keyboard at the same time, withought glitches
 based on pollserial.cpp and PS2Keyboard.cpp
 Combined by Yotson, october 2011
 
 ps2 keyboard library which uses the usart hardware for buffering individual bits into a byte before reading the byte by software.
 Goal was to use a ps2 keyboard in combination with tv-out without image/timing corruption. 
 The interrupt driven version of ps2 keyboard messed with tv out image/timing.

 Tested on atmega328. Not compatible with arduino mega/mega2560 as the XCKn pins are not broken out to header/pad.

| ps2-Keyboard pin   |  Arduino pin         |
| -------------------| ---------------------|
| data               |  RX, digital pin 0   |
| clock              |  XCK, digital pin 4  |
| ground             |  Ground              |
| 5V                 |  5V                  |

 Version 2.1 (May 2011)
 - timeout to recover from misaligned input
 - compatibility with Arduino "new-extension" branch
 - TODO: send function, proposed by Scott Penrose, scooterda at me dot com
 
 Version 2.0 (June 2010)
 - Buffering added, many scan codes can be captured without data loss
 if your sketch is busy doing other work
 - Shift keys supported, completely rewritten scan code to ascii
 - Slow linear search replaced with fast indexed table lookups
 - Support for Teensy, Arduino Mega, and Sanguino added

 Slightly modified by Bill Peterson (albedozero@gmail.com) 2016
  to work with Arduino 1.6.4+
